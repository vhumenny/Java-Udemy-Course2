Splitting Strings is a very frequent operation; this quick tutorial is focused on some of the API
we can use to do this simply in Java.
Let's start with the core library – the String class itself offers a split() method –
which is very convenient and sufficient for most scenarios.
It simply splits the given String based on the delimiter, returning an array of Strings.
Let's now split by multiple characters – a comma, space, and hyphen through regex.
Apache's common lang package provides a StringUtils class – which contains a null-safe split() method,
that splits using whitespace as the default delimiter
